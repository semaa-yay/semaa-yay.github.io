        <div id= "info"><p>Hi !! This is my first webpage that I started on July
        1st, 2024. I hope to see a lot of improvement in my coding and touch typing skills as I continue to practice.
        I am really excited to learn about the posibilty of the different fonts I will be able to use in CSS. I am eagar
        to learn JS and Python. I hope I will get better at touch typing because I hate doing it. I want to be able to 
        memorize the positioning in JavaScript because it is really confusing. #cantWaitforCarver!!!</p>

       <p> July 2nd, 2024.. For some reason the line break keeps duplicating my code which is really annoying. I hate 
            having to put code in a certain order for it to show how I want it to but oh well. The default codes for CSS
            are so bland and ugly. Sorry, but I don't want to use Comic Sans all the time. Why is it so difficult to use
             google fonts. I don't want to have to create links to get a font. This is font isn't that cute but it's better 
            than Comic Sans and Ariel. For some reason I can't figure out a way to bold the title... This live preview keeps
            showing a busted version of the code until I refresh it. Maybe that's why the line break wasn't working. Line break
            works now !!</p>
